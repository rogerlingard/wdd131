			<h3>Projects</h3>
			<p>After my first python Class I decieded that I wanted to expand my skills and learn about how to open files and use them. I also wanted to practice the pinao but I did not know what songs to play. So I got a random list and wrote a python program to randomly pick a piece for me to play for that day so I could have a fresh selection of pieces.
                The second project that I worked on was a friendship journal where you could save entries of when you interacted with your friends last. This was after I had learned about functions so I was applying my learning once again to writing files with a CSV and using date time with python. This program was to encourage meeting with your friends and to “renew” your friendship as you would have an incentive to meet your friends. 

The last project I worked on was the fitness frog app. I did this during the BYU-I hackathon where I stayed up for twenty-four hours to make a program. We made an app that took the information from your apple fitness app and depending on how many times you did a workout then you would help a frog grow up. But if you did not exercise after a bit then the frog would die. It was a way to gamify working out and to encourage consistent working out.
Events: BYU-I Hackathon 2024</p>

				Create two wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them
				here
